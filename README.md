All sides equal triangle is equilateral     3 sides                                equilateral
                                             A=B,B=c,A=c
two sides equal                             3 sides
                                              A=B,B!=c,A=c                          isoscles
  one side equal                            3 sides                                        
                                             A!=c,B!=C,A!=B                         scalene
